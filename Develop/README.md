## Description

An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

Run "npm i" to download dependencies before startup.

## Usage

After initiating server by running "node server" in the terminal, the user can navigate to localhost:8080 to use the application. On the title screen, click "Get Started" to be taken to the note creation screen. Once there, each note has two fields to be filled out: a Title field to label the note, and a text field to enter the content. Upon typing in either of these fields, a save icon will populate to the upper right of the screen. When the note is completed, clicking the save icon will display the note title on the column to the left for future review or editing. The trash can icon by each title will delete that note.

## Tools
